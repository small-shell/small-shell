Team App This App template could manage not only Team events, but also tasks, shared drive, bookmarks and inquiries. Team App funcions Function type Description Calendar main Manage team events in main page Announcements sub-app Share announcement to the team Tasks sub-app Manage team tasks {assignment,status,deadline,sync_calendar} Inquiries sub-app Manage inquiryes from external users Drive sub-app Provide storage that have optional link to share file to external users Bookmarks sub-app Manage bookmarks Inquiry form Inquiry Form to the Team Link to code is here cd /var/tmp git clone https://github.com/naruoken/small-shell-apps cd small-shell-apps/team_app #if you already careated events and tasks databoxes, please delete it. #rm -rf /usr/local/small-shell/databox/events #rm -rf /usr/local/small-shell/databox/tasks # Deploy Team App, shell can createe databox as well sudo ./deploy.sh Add user to Team App Please add user to the App, Then you can get key to access team main. sudo /usr/local/small-shell/adm/ops app:team add.usr:test Access URL of Team App There is 2 URL for using Team App, 1 is for App user, 1 is external user for inquiry. please try to use. # Team App https://${FQND}/team # Inquiry Form https://${FQDN}/inquiry Oauth integration If you want to use Oauth, it's recommended to select other type App. sudo /usr/local/small-shell/adm/gen -app Type of App (1.BASE | 2.FORM | 3.CUSTOM): 3 app_name: oauth_test Type of Authentication (1.shared pass | 2.user key | 3.other | 4.none): 3 We made sample script that can be integrated with Oauth provider, please get each parameter from Oauth provider beforehand. # input small-shell app name app=\"oauth_test\" echo $app cd /var/tmp git clone https://github.com/naruoken/small-shell-apps # select provider provider=\"gcp\" cd small-shell-apps/oauth_sample/authorization_code # UPDATE PARAMA vi ./cgi-bin/${provider}_auth #------------------------------------------------ # target params exchange_token_uri=\"\" user_info_req_uri=\"\" redirect_uri=\"\" client_id=\"\" client_secret=\"\" target_claim=\"\" #------------------------------------------------- # sample input #------------------------------------------------ #exchange_token_uri=\"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token\" #user_info_req_uri=\"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo?\" #redirect_uri=\"http://XXX/cgi-bin/auth.oauth_test\" #client_id=\"XXX.apps.googleusercontent.com\" #client_secret=\"XXXX\" #target_claim=\"email\" vi ./def/${provider}_oauth_form.html.def #------------------------------------------------ # target params var CLIENT_ID = ''; var REDIRECT_URI = ''; var OAUTH_END_POINT = ''; var SCOPE = ''; var STATE = ''; #------------------------------------------------- # sample input #------------------------------------------------ # var CLIENT_ID = 'XXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com'; # var REDIRECT_URI = 'http://XXXX/cgi-bin/auth.oauth_test'; # var OAUTH_END_POINT = 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth'; # var SCOPE = 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email'; # var STATE = 'statee'; #------------------------------------------------ # DEPLOY authkey=$(grep authkey= /var/www/cgi-bin/auth.$app | sed \"s/authkey=\\\"//g\" | sed \"s/\\\"//g\") echo $authkey cat ./cgi-bin/${provider}_auth | sed \"s/%%authkey/${authkey}/g\" | sed \"s/%%app/${app}/g\" > .auth.$app sudo cp .auth.$app /var/www/cgi-bin/auth.$app . /usr/local/small-shell/web/base cat ./def/${provider}_oauth_form.html.def | sed \"s#%%static_url/#$static_url#g\" | sed \"s/%%app/${app}/g\" > .${app}_auth_form.html.def sudo cp .${app}_auth_form.html.def /var/www/def/${app}_auth_form.html.def sudo chmod 755 /var/www/cgi-bin/auth.$app Then you can try to connect App through Oauth. https://${fqdn}/cgi-bin/auth.oauth_test Delete Scratech App You can delete your custom App by using util script as following. usage: sudo /usr/local/small-shell/util/scripts/del_app.sh $app Technical Tips This is technical Tips. It could be hint for making your own custom App. 1. Get ID & key's value You can get text name using ID and key using \"none\" format @bin/script (shell) # get name which will be issued DATA_SHELL=\"sudo -u small-shell ${small_shell_path}/bin/DATA_shell session:$session pin:$pin\" book_name=$($DATA_SHELL databox:book.master action:get key:name id:$id format:none | $AWK -F \":\" '{print $2}') 2. ID search by using Name You can also get ID using 100% matched text @bin/script (shell) # get book ID Based on the name DATA_SHELL=\"sudo -u small-shell ${small_shell_path}/bin/DATA_shell session:$session pin:$pin\" book_id=$($DATA_SHELL databox:book.master command:show_all[match=name{$book_name}] format:json | jq '.[] | .id'| $SED -s \"s/\\\"//g\") 3.
